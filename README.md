## 🎨 Tailwind CSS Setup

Tailwind is preconfigured with PostCSS. You can start using utility classes directly in your components.

```html
<div className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded">
  Welcome to the shop!
</div>
```

---

## 🔁 Routing (React Router v7+)

Routes are managed using `react-router-dom` v7:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import Product from "./pages/Product";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/product/:id" element={<Product />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

---

## 🧠 State Management (Redux Toolkit)

Redux store is set up using `@reduxjs/toolkit`.

```js
// src/app/store.js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import cartReducer from '../features/cart/cartSlice';

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    cart: cartReducer,
  },
});
```

Then wrap your app with `<Provider>`:

```jsx
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { store } from './app/store';

<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>
```
